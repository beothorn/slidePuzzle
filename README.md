# Slide Puzzle

A godot plugin to create puzzles with sliding pieces optmized for touch screens.

# [Demo/Tutorial](http://www.isageek.com.br/slidePuzzle/)

The idea is to have pieces that can only slide through fixed paths and need to be moved to the goal.

It keeps the pieces on path while dragging it. It also smooths the pieces movements.

You can have many pieces that work on many goals or a goal for each piece.
